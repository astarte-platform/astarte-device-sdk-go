	AutoReconnect bool

	// ConnectRetry sets whether the device should retry to connect if the first connection
	// fails. Defaults to false.
	ConnectRetry bool

	// MaxRetries sets the number of attempts for the device to establish the first connection.

	// KeepAlive defines the amount of time that the MQTT client
	// should wait before sending a PING request to the broker. This will
	// allow the MQTT client to know that a connection has not been lost with Astarte.

	// PersistencyDir is a known path that will be used by the SDK for MQTT
	// persistency, for the default database if used, and for crypto storage unless
	// CryptoDir is specified.

	// an error will be returned upon creation.
	//
	// Creating a Device without persistency is not recommended and should be done only
	// when aware of the implications. Please read all documentation for details.
	PersistencyDir string

	// CryptoDir is a known, available path that will be used by the SDK for storing
	// certificate and private key for connecting to Astarte. When not specified, it
	// will use the PersistencyDir if specified, or a temporary directory if no persistency
	// was enabled. Please keep in mind that if a temporary directory is used for crypto
	// storage, certificates and private keys will always be regenerated at each startup,
	// which will take a toll on performances and startup times.
	CryptoDir string

	// UseDatabase defines whether the SDK should use a database for properties
	// and datastream persistency. It will be stored in the specified PersistencyDir.
	// When set to true, and no database is provided, the default database (SQLite) will
	// be used.
	UseDatabase bool

	// Database is a pointer to a valid, open gorm DB to be used for persistency, provided
	// UseDatabase is true. Ensure you're passing a dedicated DB which
	// can be used exclusively by the Astarte SDK to prevent naming conflicts.
	// If both this variable is nil and UseDatabase is false, no database will be used.
	// Not using a database when you can rely on persistency is strongly discouraged - however,
	// there might be cases in which such a thing is needed, for example if you cannot use CGO
	// when compiling your executable.
